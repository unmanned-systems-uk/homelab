## CPU Authentication

### Check CPU Top Markings
All genuine Intel CPUs have laser etching on top:

**i9-10980XE Example:**
```
Intel Core i9-10980XE
SRGSG (S-Spec code)
L943xxxx (Batch number)
```

### Verify Against Intel ARK
1. Go to: https://ark.intel.com/
2. Search CPU model
3. Compare:
   - S-Spec code matches
   - Core count matches
   - Base/Boost clocks match

**i9-10980XE Specs:**
- S-Spec: SRGSG (retail), CD8069504381900 (OEM)
- Cores: 18
- Threads: 36
- Base: 3.0 GHz
- Boost: 4.6 GHz
- Socket: FCLGA2066

**i9-10940X Specs:**
- S-Spec: SRGSH
- Cores: 14
- Threads: 28
- Base: 3.3 GHz
- Boost: 4.6 GHz

## Testing CPU When It Arrives

### Step 1: Visual Inspection
1. Check CPU top markings match description
2. Inspect for physical damage
3. Look for bent pins on motherboard socket (pins are on board, not CPU)

### Step 2: Installation Test
1. Install CPU in your X299 board
2. Apply thermal paste
3. Install cooler
4. Boot to BIOS

### Step 3: BIOS Verification
- CPU model shows correctly?
- Core count correct? (18 cores = 36 threads)
- Clock speeds match specs?

### Step 4: Stability Test (24 hours)
**Software:**
- Prime95 (torture test) - 1 hour minimum
- AIDA64 (stress test) - 2 hours
- Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool

**What to monitor:**
- Temps stay below 85°C
- No crashes or freezes
- All cores detected and active
- Clock speeds boost properly

**If CPU fails test:**
- Contact seller immediately
- Initiate return/refund
- Document with screenshots

---

## Return Window Strategy

### First 48 Hours (Critical)
- [ ] Visual inspection
- [ ] BIOS detection test
- [ ] 1-hour Prime95 stress test
- [ ] Check all cores functional

### Days 3-7
- [ ] Extended stress testing
